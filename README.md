# C++

Object oriented programming in C++ is the type of programming that mainly deals with givibg real world properties to our programming. So, this means to match the real world entities, and make programming evolve in such a way that it could be made to extend to develop real world entities, we use object oriented programming. Now the parts of Object Oriented Programming in C++ are:-

Classes and Objects -  Classes are made in C++ to give properties and attributes to the objects. So objects are called instances of classes.

Abstraction:- Abstraction deals with telling only the significant details to the user without knowing the inner knitty gritties of the working.

Encapsulation- This means to add up under one roof. That means like in a capsule, we have different elements, inserted in one capsule to deliver the desired results, similarly, in OOPs in C++ we encapsulate the data members and member functions in one class to give desired properties to the object.

Modularity- Modularity is just the opposite of encapsulation. When you encapsulate all the things in one, you can also disintegrate it into finer details to form different modules

Inheritance- Very important. Inheritance is the same as in layman terms we use. This is what we inherit from our parents, forefathers, ancestors.

Polymorphism- These are functions with the same name but different parameters. In real life example, I would say, suppose we have area as a function. But we can have area of more than one shape right.
